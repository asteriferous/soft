# project description:
"a soft space" is a webpage designed for self-care. while most certainly not exhaustive, it is meant to provide a few resources for anyone who may not be feeling well emotionally, whether that is in the form of breathing exercises, gentle encouragements, or pretty distractions. it is titled "a soft space" because it is a safe space that is kind and gentle where you can be as emotionally vulnerable as you need and trust that nothing will hurt you.

check out "a soft space" <a href="welcome.html">here</a>.

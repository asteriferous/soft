# project description:
"a soft space" is a webpage designed for self-care. while most certainly not exhaustive, it is meant to provide a few resources for anyone who may not be feeling well emotionally, whether that is in the form of breathing exercises, gentle encouragements, or pretty distractions. it is titled "a soft space" because it is a safe space that aims to soften the harshness of reality on anyone currently suffering.

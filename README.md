# project description:
we made a HTML page/pseudo-website (please click welcome.html), titled "soft", designed for self-care. while most certainly not exhaustive, it is meant to provide a few resources for anyone who is not feeling well emotionally and is seeking something to help them feel alive, whether that is in the form of breathing exercises, gentle encouragements, or pretty distractions. the title of this project is "soft" because we want to provide a safe space where you can be as vulnerable and hurting as you need, where everything is soft and kind and you are loved.
